# Rubik-s-Cube-Solver
A little program in C# that solves a rubik's cube now matter how it was shuffled.

First of all, to to be able to use the app, you should be familiar with Rubik's Cube notations: https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/advanced/

Once you've learned them, all you have to do is to paint the cube's stickers as they are on your real cube. You can do that by selecting the color of your "brush", in the bottom-left area.
